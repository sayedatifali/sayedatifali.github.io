### Work Experience
**Intel Security** *(Jul '11 - present)*

* Worked in the Innovation team responsible for driving innovation at McAfee, conceptualizing and
implementing proof of concepts of potential products
* Designed and wrote an iOS app to manage Little Red Plug (LRP), a home network security product. iOS app could control LRP protection status, manage alerts, users and pair/unpair new LRP’s
* Deployed a web service on Amazon EC2 instance to enable syncing of iOS app with LRP
* Conceived of an APNs and WebSocket based architecture to implement syncing of LRP with iOS app
* Wrote an asynchronous transparent DNS proxy in C on Linux. Intercepts DNS request packets/lookups, blocks or allows domain lookup based on policies set
* Introduced multithreading in the DNS proxy, more than doubling the throughput
* Created an async RESTful API wrapper over McAfee’s [GTI](http://www.mcafee.com/us/threat-center/technology/gti-reputation-technologies.aspx){:target="_blank"} URL rating server. Leveraged redis as message broker queue and celery worker threads to scale with network peeks
* Built an Android app to display real time notifications generated by LRP using [Android GCM](https://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html){:target="_blank"}
